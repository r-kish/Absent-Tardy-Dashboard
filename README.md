# Absences / Tardies Dashboard

This project was created during my time working at a vocational school. The goal was to create a concise dashboard to monitor the absence/tardy behavior of the entire student body, with details on whose class was being cut, and when they were being cut. 

All data has been anonymized, and any sensitive data has been removed and unused. Data cleaning and all three dashboards were done entirely in Excel. The date range for this project is the entirety of March 2024.

[Note: UA indicates that the student was absent all day, where Non-UA indicates the student was present for some of the day.]

Dashboard 1: Non-UA Absences/Tardies and UA Absences/Tardies
